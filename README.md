The website has a modern and stylish design with a black background, white typography, and bold accent colors. The navigation menu is located at the top of the page and links to different sections of the site, including the homepage, about, portfolio, services, and contact pages.

The main content of the website consists of a portfolio of the studio's web design projects, along with information about their services and team. The website also includes a blog section with articles about web design and development topics.

The website appears to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, making it easy to view and navigate on both desktop and mobile devices. The design is well-organized, with a clear and consistent layout and easy-to-read typography.
